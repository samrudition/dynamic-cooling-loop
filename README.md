# Dynamic Liquid Cooling Loop 
A transient thermal simulation framework for active liquid cooling loops used in data centers, electric vehicles, and industrial systems. Built in MATLAB/Simulink, this model captures the dynamic interaction between a heat source (server rack, battery pack, or process load), pump flow rate, and heat exchanger effectiveness to predict cooling performance under real-world variable loads. It also includes pump control logic and thermal stability analysis critical for safe, efficient operation of high-density compute and energy storage systems.

## Project Overview
