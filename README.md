# dynamic-cooling-loop
Transient thermal simulation of active liquid cooling loops for data centers, EVs, and industrial systems. This MATLAB/Simulink model captures dynamic interactions between heat sources, pump flow, and heat exchanger performance under variable loads. Includes control logic and thermal stability analysis for high-density compute and energy storage.
